# Banking

You are asked to collaborate with Airgead Banking, one of Chada Tech’s clients. 
Airgead Banking is well known in the community. They often sponsor schools and have recently 
decided to partner with the local high school to develop a program that will teach students the concepts of fiscal 
responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive system. The initial
focus for this project will be on investing and the power of compound interest. You will develop an application that allows 
users to see how their investments will grow over time. Airgead Banking has provided you with a list of functional requirements that 
describe what they need their application to do.

Directions:

1. Review the Airgead Banking App Functional Requirements, located in the Supporting Materials section. Create pseudocode or a flowchart 
to plan your coding project. Outline your code step-by-step so that you can use it as a guide when coding. 
This will be submitted along with your zipped application.
Do not write code yet. You will do that in Step 3. For this step, write your thoughts in English of what the program should do.
Don’t be concerned with syntax, just list statements, each describing a single action.
List all steps.
Use proper naming conventions.
Keep it simple—use only one statement per line.

2. Develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application using secure and efficient C++ code. Make sure that your application:
Meets all specifications listed in the Airgead Banking App Functional Requirements
Follows best practices described in the Airgead Banking Standards document
Includes in-line comments

3. When your solution is finished, zip your project including all components (CPP, H, and any other files used).

4. Upload your zipped project file and pseudocode or flowchart to the project submission area.

I think I did a good job organizing my code and making it as thought I didn't need to use more lines of code than necessary. 
I also enjoyed making the display for the results.
I'm not sure where I could have improved on my code, not saying that I used the most efficient way, but I feel like I used a very direct
approach to creating my program.

To overcome roadblocks, I used resource websites such as geeksforgeeks or w3schools.

Skills that I have learned from this project can be transferable to other projects include the problem solving aspect. 
To be given a problem to fix and an outline of rules and create something out of it is a very useful skill for the future.

I made this code maintainable and easy to read by using a lot of comments and adhering to the guidlines provided to me by the
company.
